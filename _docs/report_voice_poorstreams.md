**Voice+ Report Only**

The Voice Poor Streams Report will display all streams that were marked as poor for any reason for a particular month.  This report can be downloaded to Microsoft Excel format.

**Note:** A stream is different than a call.  A call may have several streams included.  For example, a Peer to Peer call may have two (2) total streams.  Whereas a call to the PSTN would have four (4).
