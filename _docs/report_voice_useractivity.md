**Voice+ Report Only**

The Voice User Activity Report will display a summary of outbound PSTN calls for the selected users and date range.  In the *Select A User* box enter the name(s) of the individual syou want to search for within the system.  The user must be enabled for Skype for Business and you can search based on first name.

In the date fields, select a *Start* and *End* date for your report.  Click on Generate Report.

The resulting table will show the total weeks, total number of calls, those answered and averages per week.  A call is determined answered based on the signaling received from the far party and the length of call.  This should be treated as an estimated number of answered calls as it is impossible to know without speaking to the individual if a call was indeed answered by the far party.
