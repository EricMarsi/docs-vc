**Voice+ Report Only**

The Voice User Ratings Report will display user submitted call rating information.  At the conclusion of some Skype for Business calls and conferences a user can elect to supply information about the call within a five star rating.  Users can choose not to submit any information.  Additionally, users submissions are subjective and may provide feedback as well.

**Note:** This feature can be disabled if an administrator wishes to.  Please submit a ticket to disable this feature.

The first chart displays a user by user basis and the average score rating.
