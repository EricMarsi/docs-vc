## Privacy and Relationship Levels

Skype for Business allows you to assign each of your contacts to a variety of relationship levels, each of which grants access to varying degrees of information about you, such as your Home and Mobile phone numbers, your meeting details, Notes, Location, etc.

Right click on a contact and click Change Privacy Relationship to choose from the following options:

* Friends and Family
* Workgroup
* Colleagues
* External Contacts
* Blocked Contacts
* Auto-assign Relationship

You may view the existing privacy levels assigned to all of your contacts by clicking the Relationships tab. Within this tab, you can quickly change multiple contact privacy levels by dragging and dropping them into different groups.

## Publishing Phone Numbers

To view, publish, or modify your phone numbers within Skype for Business, click the gear icon to open the options menu. Within the options menu, click Phones on the left side.

Click on the phone you would like to add or edit. Check the box next to "include in my contact card" for numbers you want available to other Skype for Business users. When specifying phone numbers, enter the country code, an area code, and the local number. Do no use alphanumeric numbers. A U.S. number might look like: 4255550101, 14255550101, or +14255550101.

## Scheduling a Skype for Business Meeting

You may schedule Skype for Business meetings from within the Outlook client. Navigate to the Calendar section and select New Skype Meeting (Note: Appearance and location may vary slightly depending on software version)

On the resulting screen, enter the attendees, date, time, etc. just as in a regular Outlook appointment. From within the meeting setup window, you may also alter some of the meeting options.

The default online meeting options are best for small conference calls or sharing and collaboration sessions with people inside your organization. If you are scheduling an online meeting with people outside of your organization or your meetin is unusally large, you may want to change some options. The Meeting Options menu contains helpful links for furhter determining which option is best for you.

### Option 2: Using the Web Scheduler

The Web Scheduler is a standalone tool that allows you to schedule Skype for Business meetings with dial-in access. It is particularly useful for scheduling meetings from mobile devices or in situations where the Outlook Plug-In is not available.  

1.	Navigate to the <a href="https://scheduler.t2mhosted.com">web scheduler</a>.
2. Login using your Skype for Business credentials.
3. Fill in the meeting details. The required fields are Event, Start Time, and End Time- all other fields are optional
4.	Click Save and a pop-up will appear containing a link to the meeting and the conference dial-in information.
5.	Copy this information from the pop-up and paste it into your Outlook invitation that you send to other users. 

Your meeting is now scheduled and ready to be sent out.

## Communicating with Skype (Consumer client) Users

Cross-platform communication between Skype for Business and the Skype consumer client is both possible and easy to establish. However, despite the shared "Skype" branding, they're significantly different products under the hood. As such, not all featers are compatible when communicating across platforms

**What Works**
* Audio Calls
* Video Calls
* Instant Messagin (IM)

**What Doesn't Work**
* Conference Calls (3 or more people)

The most important thing to consider is that the Skype consumer user **must be added to the Skype for Business user's contact list** before communication can occur.

1. Open Skype for Business and search for the Skype contact that you would like to communicate with. You may search for them by typing their Skye ID/Skype Username, phone number(**must** include country code), or e-mail address into the search bar. It is recommended to search for Skype ID or phone number
2. The software defaults to searching within your existing contacts only. Click **SKYPE DIRECTORY** to search for the user in the Global Skype Directory instead.
3. Locate the individual you would like to add. Right click on them, choose "Add to Contacts List" and select which Contacts group you would like to add them to. NOTE: Do **not** select "Add to Favorites"- it will not work. The user **MUST** be added to a contact list.
4. Your Skype for Business client will now display a message that your contact request has been sent. The Skype Consumer user must accept your contact request. This can take a few minutes to occur and should be done via the Skype Dektop Application. Once accepted, you can now IM and make Audio/Video calls
