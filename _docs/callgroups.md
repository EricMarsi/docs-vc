## Main Page

The Call Groups Management allows you to manage all aspects of your Skype for Business Call Groups.:

The call groups page allows you to see all call group devices that are enabled for Skype for Business.  At the top of each column is the ability to filter rows based on a specific search criteria.  When selecting a call group device, a fly-out window will appear from the right side of the screen.  This will include the ability to modify properties and see call history.

## Modify Existing Call Group

When selecting a device from the table of existing call groups, you will see the following page appear.

> **Important:** By default, editing is disabled when you open up any account.  You must select the Enable Editing button.  Once you do this, you can modify the settings for the account.  When you make a change, that change takes effect immediately.  **There is no save button required.**

### Members

**Ring Group Members** is a list of users who are assigned as members of the call group.  Click on each member will remove that user from the call group list.  Members of the call group, will receive all inbound calls placed to this number.

**Add Call Group Member** allows you to add an existing Skype for Business user to your call group.

### Forwarding

**Ring Rules** determines how many calls can be placed into the ring group at a single time.  For example, if you select 5 calls, the 6 simataneous call into the call group would follow the no answer rules.

**No Answer Rules** determines how calls should be handled in event that no one answers the call.

### Voice

**Phone Number** is the assigned phone number and extension for the call group. Clicking on this dropdown box will display a list of all available unassigned numbers that can be assigned to the call group.  

### Call History

Call History will bring you to a personalized Call Detail Record page for the call group, including some basic info on their account details.  Double-clicking on any of these calls will bring you to the in-depth Call Detail page for that call, described more thoroughly in a later section.
