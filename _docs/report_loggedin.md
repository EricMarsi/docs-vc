**Voice+ Report Only**

The Logged In Users Report gives you an up to the moment view of who is currently logged into the Skype for Business clients.  These logins could be from Windows, Macintosh, IP Phone or other devices.

The report will also include the type of client being used and if possible, the version of the client that is currently being used by that user.

The report can be exported to Microsoft Excel.
