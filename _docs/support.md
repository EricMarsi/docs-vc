## Number Management

### Requests

Need new phone numbers.  Or do you need to submit a port request.  Use the Request page to update your phone numbers.

### PSTN Forward

Need to forward a PSTN number?  Use the PSTN Forwards page to easily forward all Meeting Rooms, Call Groups and more.  Remember, if you need to forward the individual number of a user you can do this at the user.  This is a forward at the Carrier so you will not see any CDR information reguarding this forwarded number.

### Number Ranges

Shows all of the number ranges defined for your organization.

### Phone Numbers

Shows every phone number in your organization and who is it assigned to.
