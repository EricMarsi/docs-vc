## Publish Your Phone Numbers and Control Who Sees Them 
You can assign levels of access to your contacts to control their access to your presence information. Different attributes are  exposed for each presence level, such as Block, External, Colleague, Workgroup, and Friends and Family. For example, Mobile Phone is available at the Workgroup level, but not at the Colleague level.

### Edit and publish your phone numbers 
In the Lync title bar, click the Menu button, point to Tools, click Options, and then click Phones. Click the button for the number that you want to add or edit. After you have  entered the number, select the Include in my contact card box for those numbers that you want to make visible to other Communicator users.

### Control access to your phone numbers 
After you publish your phone numbers, you must assign Access Levels to those contacts who you want to see your phone numbers. If you want a contact to see your Home and Mobile phone numbers, assign the contact to the Friends and Family level. If you want them to see only your Work and Mobile numbers, assign them to the 
Workgroup level. To assign a contact to an Access Level, right-click the contact, point to Change Privacy Relationship, and then select the access level.

## About phone number formats 
When specifying phone numbers, enter the country code, an area code, and the local number, using only the digits 0123456789. Do not use alphanumeric numbers. A U.S. number might look like: 4255550101, 14255550101, or +14255550101.

## Polycom CX 600 Phone

### Physically Connecting the Phone

The first step in settin up and installing a VoIP phone is connecting all the necessary cables. You will need to:

1. Connect the phone to your network via Ethernet cable. This is typically done by disconnecting the Ethernet cable from your computer and plugging it into the phone's LAN port. There are multiple Ehternet ports on the phone- make sure that this cable is plugged into the LAN port and **not** the PC port.
2. Using a second Ethernet cable, connect the phone to the computer by plugging one end into the phone's PC port and other into the Ethernet port on your computer.
3. (OPTIONAL) Plug the power adapter into the back of the phone. This hsould start the initialization process for your phone.
4. Plug the USB Cable into the back of the phone and then connect to your computer. Make sure to fuly push the cable into the back of the phone. Your computer will download the drivers needed for the phone, this may take a few minutes.
5. At this time, your phone should be starting up. Allow the phone to complete the initialization process.
6. While the phone boots up, make sure to connect the handset with the cable provided. The plastic guide slides into the back of the phone to determine the angle it stands at.

### Configuring the Phone

1. Press the Select button to begin
2. Select Yes and choose English
3. Your computer will now prompt you to login again. The account and username should be the same as you use to log in to your Skype for Business Client.
4. The phone will start the login process. This might take a few minutes.
5. After login, enter your new 4 digit unlock pin. This pin exists to prevent people from checking your voicemail when you are away from your desk. By default, your phone logs into voicemail automatically when you are in the office. You will need to enteer it twice.
6. The phone will walk you through a wizard by selecting next. This will include choosing your time zone, date format, and more. Once completed, your phone is ready to be used.

### Using the Phone

### Transferring Calls

1. While on the call, click the menu button
2. Use the arrow key and select **Transfer Directly to...**
3. Use the arrow keys to select the name of the person you want to transfer to, or enter the phone number of who you want to transfer to.
4. Click the Right Select button to transfer the call.

## Polycom VVX Phone ##

The purpose of this guide is to walk you through the successful installation of a VVX Phone for use with Skype for Business in conjunction with Time2Market Cloud Services. Please note that the screenshots used throughout this guide may not match your phone exactly, as there are minor differences between VVX models. However, the fundamental menus involved are similar across all devices.  

### Connecting the Phone ###
The first step, of course, is connecting all the necessary cables. Luckily, there aren’t very many. You will need to: 
1.	Power the phone. This can be done either through a direct power adapter plugged into an AC outlet or through a Power over Ethernet (PoE) adapter.  
2.	Connect the phone to your network via Ethernet cable. This is typically done by disconnecting the Ethernet cable from your computer and plugging it into the phone’s LAN port. There are multiple Ethernet ports on the phone – make sure that this cable is plugged into the LAN port and not the Computer port.  
3.	Using a second Ethernet cable, connect the phone to the computer by plugging one end into the phone’s PC port and the other into the Ethernet port on your computer. This step is technically not required, but it will insure the best connectivity for configuration (and is necessary for BToE sign-in functionality).  

### Enable Web Server ###
In order to access the web-based confiuration menu, it is necessary that the Web Server option is enabled on the phone.
1. Press the Home key and then browse to the follwing menu: Settings>Advanced>(Enter default Admind code 456 on the keypad)>Administration Settings>Web Server Configuration
2.	Select Web Server and choose the Enabled option.  
3.	Select Web Config Mode and choose HTTP/HTTPS (barring a specific reason your organization has to choose another option) 
4.	Select Back and then Save Config to save the changes. The phone will now restart.  

### Verify & Update Software Version ###
Once the phone has restarted, you will next connect to the phone’s web server in order to verify and possibly update the software version.  
1.	On the phone go to Settings > Status > Network > TCP/IP Parameters and note the IP Address assigned to the phone.  If the phone does not have an IP Address, you need to troubleshoot why that is the case. A good place to start would be to double-check the physical connections to and from the phone.  
2.	Open a browser and connect to the IP Address.    
3.	Login to the phone with the default admin credentials of ‘456’ 
4.	On the resulting page, go to Utilities | Software Upgrade 
5.	Ensure that the version of software assigned to the phone is 5.2.x or later.  If the current software version is anything but this, click the “Check for Updates” button (leave Polycom Hosted Server selected). 
6.	The drop-down menu will now display a list of software versions you can install. Select the latest version and choose Install.  Your phone will reboot several times during this process, which can take up to 10 minutes.  

### Enable Lync Mode ###
After the phone has been upgraded, you must enable Lync Mode on the phone.
1. Hold down the key combo of 1, 4, & 9 for three seconds. It will display the Base Profile page. The default password is '456'
2. Selec Lync as the Base Profile. The phone will reboot after the selection.

### Sign in ###
There are two solutions for signing the phones in- Better Together over Ethernet (BToE) and Stand Alond Phone.

**BToE Sign-in**

First, we must enable BToE on the phone itself.
1. Click Home Button> Settings> Features> BTOE
2. Enable BTOE

Second, we must configure the workstation to pair with the phone.
1. Ensure your POlycom VVX Phone is tethered via Ethernet to your computer. The computer must be plugged in via wired/Ethernet connection that comes from the phone.
2. Ensure that the computer is not connected to Wi-Fi in addition to the wired Ethernet connection.
3. Download and install the latest version of Polycom BToE based on the firmware you have installed on your phone 
4. Launch the Polycom BToE application. You should see a message declaring a successful pairing with the phone within a minute. Once all drivers are installed, the computer will prompt for a restart.
5. Log out of Skype for Business/Lync client and log back in.
6. Your client will prompt you to log in to the phone. This can be delayed up to a minute after signing into the software itself. Input the same credentials you use to lof into Skype for Business/Lync.
7. Once your phone is logged in, you will see BToE as an option on the home screen.

**Stand Alone Phone Sign-in**

Depending on your phone, you may be immediately prompted on the phone itself for log-in credentials when the phone boots up. If this is the case, you may enter your sign-in information directly. Enter your entire Skype for Business / Lync user address into both the Sign-in Address and User Name fields. Enter your Skype for Business / Lync password into the Password field. You may leave the Domain and other fields blank.

You may also establish your credentials through the web configuration server.  

1. Navigate to the phone’s IP address and sign in as admin (456). 
2. Go to Utilities > Lync SignIn
3.	Enter your sign-in name, username and password.  You can leave domain, extension and pin blank.  
4.	Your phone will now be signed into Lync

### Enabling Audible Ringtone

By default, Polycom VVX phones are set to disable Shared Line Appearance (SLA) ring tones.  This means that the calls will “ring” the device, but the phone will be silent with no audible sound coming from the device.  Instead, the Skype for Business client will ring and use the default computer ring sound. Many end users prefer the phone itself to ring – the purpose of this guide is thus to provide the steps necessary in order to enable audible ringtones for shared line phones.  

1.	Press the Home button 
2.	Navigate to Settings -> Basic -> Ring Type and select your desired ringtone.  
3.	Hit back until prompted to save your configuration.
