## Publish Your Phone Numbers and Control Who Sees Them 
You can assign levels of access to your contacts to control their access to your presence information. Different attributes are  exposed for each presence level, such as Block, External, Colleague, Workgroup, and Friends and Family. For example, Mobile Phone is available at the Workgroup level, but not at the Colleague level.

### Edit and publish your phone numbers 
In the Lync title bar, click the Menu button, point to Tools, click Options, and then click Phones. Click the button for the number that you want to add or edit. After you have  entered the number, select the Include in my contact card box for those numbers that you want to make visible to other Communicator users.

### Control access to your phone numbers 
After you publish your phone numbers, you must assign Access Levels to those contacts who you want to see your phone numbers. If you want a contact to see your Home and Mobile phone numbers, assign the contact to the Friends and Family level. If you want them to see only your Work and Mobile numbers, assign them to the 
Workgroup level. To assign a contact to an Access Level, right-click the contact, point to Change Privacy Relationship, and then select the access level.
