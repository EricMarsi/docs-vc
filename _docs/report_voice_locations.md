**Voice+ Report Only**

The Voice Location Report will display the total number of call, poor calls and percentage of poor calls based on a per location basis.  Additionally, within that location it will display the poor calls based on various types (P2P, Conf and PSTN) and cause (Packet Loss, Round Trip, Jitter).

Clicking on a location will show you a breakdown of all calls into and out of that location to other locations within your organization, including to the PSTN.  This allows you to break down if there are location to location poor calling.

For example, P2P (Peer 2 Peer) calls that are marked as poor between locations would be an area of concern for an organization as that call media never leaves the customer network.
