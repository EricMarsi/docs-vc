* Are provided only for dialog between two individuals at one time per line. Excluding
conferencing services.
* Exclude international calling, which is available for an additional fee.

Unlimited plans also may not be used for any of the following prohibited uses (which are in addition to
the other prohibited uses applicable to all Services):

Resale Prohibited. Customer may not sell, resell, sublease, assign, license, or sublicense the Services or
any component thereof or use or offer the same on a service-bureau or time-sharing basis.
In addition, unusually high usage of the Services may impair Time2Market Cloud Service's ability to
provide high quality Services to others and/or indicate unauthorized use of the Services, in which case 
Time2Market Cloud Service may suspend or terminate Your Account or, upon prior notice, convert Your
Account to a metered calling plan that charges significantly higher usage rates.
Time2Market Cloud Service reserves the right to add to, modify or amend this Use Policy at any time for
any reason at its sole discretion.
