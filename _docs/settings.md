### Security

**Users** lists all of the users who are allowed to login to the T2M Portal.  These users can be disabled by selecting them.  Additionally, you can change the role for the user.

To allow a new user to access the T2M Portal, then click on the "Add Security User" option.  Enter the name of who should be able to login and their role they should be assigned.

**Roles** are all of the potential types of roles that are available to your organization.  There are four built-in roles and you can create an unlimited number of roles for your organization.

To crate a new role, click on the "Add Security Role" option.  Enter the name of the role.  Once the role has been created, click on the role to modify the permissions.
