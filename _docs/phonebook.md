PhoneBook is where you can keep your personal contacts stored and organized, all made easily accessible with one click functions to make a call or send an e-mail.

## All Contacts

All Contacts is where your personal contacts are shown. You can sort and search by name, company, or even notes. On this page you can view contacts, use the one click functions to make a call or send an email, add a contact, delete a contact, or edit an existing contact. 
There is also an ability to view certain directories, which can contain specific contacts.

## Creating a New Contact

When selecting “Create New Contact”, a flyover will appear that allows you to enter as much or as little information as you would like. A new contact requires at least a first name and either an e-mail address or a primary phone number. 

## View Contact Details, Edit, and Delete

Selecting a contacts name will create a flyover that displays all contact details. By default, it first appears in view only mode. The “Enable Edit” button on the top left will give you the ability to make any changes necessary.

Most changes are saved immediately. The two exceptions are adding a new secondary number and assigning to another directory- these will require you to click the corresponding buttons to add.

To delete a contact, click the trash can in the top left corner by the Enable Editing button. You will be prompted to confirm the delete before the contact is permanently removed.

## Manage Directories

You can toggle between managing contacts and managing directories. You can create different directories to organize your contacts even further. A contact can be assigned to as many directories as you wish, or none at all. On this page you can add a new directory, edit an existing directory, or delete a directory. (Note: deleting a directory will NOT delete your contacts that are assigned to that directory)
