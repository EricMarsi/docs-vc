**Voice+ Report Only**

The Voice Summary Report will display your weekly Poor Stream Performance.  At the top of the page you will see the Current Month vs the Previous Month as a breakdown of Total, Poor and Percentage of Poor Streams.

**Note:** A stream is different than a call.  A call may have several streams included.  For example, a Peer to Peer call may have two (2) total streams.  Whereas a call to the PSTN would have four (4).

The first graph displays a week by week basis of poor streams as represented in a percentage of streams.

The second graph displays a breakdown of poor streams and the cause of the poor stream.  This is represented in a percentage of the poor streams.  For example, seeing 100% poor streams for Round Trip indicates that within that time period, 100% of all poor streams were caused by Round Trip Time.
