<p>From here you may create new common area phones or modify the settings of existing ones by double-clicking on the device’s row. This will bring you to an Edit Common Area Device page, almost identical to the Edit User page described earlier in this document.</p>

<p>To add a new common area phone, click Create Common Area Phone to the right of the search bar. This will bring you to the following page, similar to enabling a new User:</p>

<p>***It is important to note that common area devices REQUIRE PIN Authentication and the corresponding necessary network configuration changes in order to function.

If you are an existing customer who is interested in setting up common area phones for the first time, please contact your project manager BEFORE enabling any devices on this page.</p>
